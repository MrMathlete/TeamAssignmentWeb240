The City of Kelsey was founded in 1932 by M. Kelsey, who quickly realized
that the sprawling fields, the pristine lake and the rolling hills
provided the perfect landscape for farming and raising a family. His
vision was to preserve the natural resources of the land and maintain a
close-knit community.<br />
<br />
Kelsey’s roots are grounded in a history of agriculture and
self-sufficiency. Our earliest citizens lived entirely off the land.
Even today, the foundation of our city is reflected in our organic
gardens, orchards and strong sense of community. Our respect for the
land and our completely organic fruits and vegetables have given our
community nationwide visibility.<br />
<br />
In the past three decades, Kelsey’s small businesses and industries
have matured tremendously, and the population continues to grow. In
honor of our city’s traditions and founder, we never lose sight of our
community and do everything we can to preserve the natural resources
that have been granted here in the beautiful City of Kelsey.</div>
